# password-cracker-demo
A simple brute force password cracker built using Python

This project gives us an idea of how a simple brute force password cracker works. 
It is intended for educational purposes only to understand password vulnerabilities.

# How it works 
The Script :
 - Attempts all possible combinations of letters, numbers and symbols up to a specific length.
 - Stops once the correct password is found.
 - Displays the number of attempts made and the time taken to crack the password.
